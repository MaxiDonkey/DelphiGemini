The audio files generated by the Text-to-Speech API are provided in PCM format.
To convert them to the WAV format, the ffmpeg tool is used with the following command:

```bash
ffmpeg -f s16le -ar 24000 -ac 1 -i out.pcm out.wav
```

To enable this conversion, **ffmpeg** must be installed in the project directory.

A PowerShell script named `install.ps1` is available in the `script` folder of the repository.
This script automates the installation of **ffmpeg** into the `bin` directory, allowing the demo application to convert PCM files to WAV.

### Installation Procedure
1. Navigate to the root directory of the project.
2. Open a PowerShell console.
3. Temporarily allow script execution, then run the installation script:

```PowerShell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
.\script\install.ps1
```

Once the script has completed, ffmpeg will be installed in the bin directory and ready for use by the application.
