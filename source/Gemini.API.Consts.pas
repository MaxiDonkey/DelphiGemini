  /// the targeted object/array payload with private-use markers and wraps the whole block as a string, preserving the
  /// exact original content through transport/interception.
  /// </para>
  /// <para>
  /// • Restoration is performed by
  /// <see cref="Gemini.API.JSONShield.TJsonPolyUnshield.Restore"/>, which re-expands the markers and rebuilds the
