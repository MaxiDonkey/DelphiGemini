- [Model discovery](further-models.md#models)
  - The models endpoint allows you to programmatically list available models and retrieve detailed metadata, such as supported capabilities and context window size.

- [Embeddings](further-embeddings.md#embeddings)
  - The Gemini API provides text embedding models that generate vector representations of words, expressions, sentences, and code.  

- [File management](further-file-managment.md)
  - Files lets you upload multimodal files (audio, images, video, documents, etc.) and reuse them inside prompts sent to Gemini models.

- [Caching](further-caching.md#caching)
  - Implicit Caching and Explicit Caching: Definitions and Explicit Cache Management

- [Batch processing](further-batch.md#batch)
  - The Batch API is used to execute large volumes of non-urgent requests asynchronously, with a ~50% cost reduction compared to the interactive API and a target completion time of ≤24 hours. 

- [Video generation (Veo)]()

- [Image generation (Imagen 4)]()

- [Vector stores]()

- [Vectorized documents and fileSearch (Interactions)]()
