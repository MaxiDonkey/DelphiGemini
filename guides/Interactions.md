## Introduction
The **Gemini Interactions API** is an experimental API designed for building applications based on Gemini models. These models are natively multimodal and can process, combine, and generate information from multiple data types, including text, code, audio, images, and video.

The API supports a range of use cases such as joint text-and-image reasoning, content generation, conversational agents, and synthesis or classification pipelines. It provides a unified interface for accessing the multimodal reasoning and transformation capabilities of Gemini models.
